Replicating the ["Productive - Habit Tracker" app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/productive-habit-tracker/id983826477) on the iTunes store. I love this app, and decided this would be a great app to replicate to learn iOS fundamentals such as:

* Core Data 
* Pushing and popping view controllers
* Potentially coordinators to manage the pushing and popping
* MVVM
* Transferring data back and forth between screens
